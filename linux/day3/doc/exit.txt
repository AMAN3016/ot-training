What is exit status?
Each command returns a status when it terminates normally or abnormally.
we can use exit status in shell scripting to display an error or take some sort of action.
every command executed by shell script or user has an exit status
It is an integer number.


0 - exit status means the command was successful without any errors.
1-225  - exit status means command has some failure
? - to check the exit status of the previously executed command

for ex
you run the command

echo "hi"
echo $?

its output will be
hi
0

as it is successful so it will show 0 as exit status

echoas ""

echo $?

is it going to return numeric value from 1-255
which means the above command didnt execute successfully
